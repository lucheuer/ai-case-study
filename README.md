# NTT DATA

## Overview and Origin


* NTT DATA was founded in 1988 and is a partially-owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) which was founded in 1967 in Tokyo, Japan. The company is still headquarted in Tokyo. NTT Data North America is headquarted in Plano, TX.

* The company was founded by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation.

* The company, which was based in the telecom industry, decided to expand by establishing a DATA communications bureau. They were early adopters and promotors of computers in Japan and succeeded in several large scale projects such as enabling banks in Japan to transfer money online in 1973.

* The spinoff project was funded by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation and the Japanese government appears to own 33% of the shares.

## Business Activities

* NTT DATA's [Data and Artificial Intelligence Team](https://benelux.nttdata.com/services/artificial-intelligence#:~:text=At%20NTT%20DATA%20we%20have,conceptualizing%20solutions%20and%20their%20viability.) is leveraging it's extensive resources and data science expertise to provide large scale analytics solutions. They provide *managed solutions* and a *Decision Architecture Framework*, based on the latest AI technology, to provide cutting edge analytics.

* The companies intended customers are likely large publicly traded corporations in a variety of different sectors. They recently partnered with Salesforce to modernize their internal application environment.

* NTT DATA offers consulting, industry solutions, business process services, IT modernization and managed services. I believe their global footprint and history of innovation and excellence in the IT field is a huge advantage that they possess in IT services.

* NTT DATA has partnerships with Google Cloud as well as IBM. They have created a joint *Center of Excellence* with IBM which is centered around IBM's Watsonx. This joint effort appears to be in line with NTT Data's core services of consulting and enterprise application implementation services.

## Landscape

* NTT Data is in the feild of IT services. Their work is multi-faceted but appears to be centered around enterprise level AI implementation and strategy consulting.

* Generative AI is definitely a theme that is recurring in the companies press releases and PR information. 

* Other major companies in this field include IBM, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Accenture, Cognizant, CapGemini, TCS, Infosys and others. 

## Results

* The impact of NTT Data has been far reaching. They employ almost 200,000 people around the world! They are one of the largest IT companies in Asia but also have significant market share globally. They operate in 50 countries around the world and are a top 10 Global IT services provider.

* The metrics used for such a large multi-national corporation are complex but in simple terms: Their 2023 revenue was close to 30 Billion USD. 

* They appear to be competing well in the market. Their recent partnership with Salesforce is certainly a win for the company.

> “We love being the experts that the experts turn to and we’re proud of our partnership with Salesforce as a reseller and AppExchange partner. We have a 360-degree partnership that includes go-to-market and now a robust environment of internal applications,” said Aaron Millstone, Chief Growth Officer, NTT DATA North America

## Recommendations

* It seems like NTT DATA is doing well by focusing most on expertise in implementation rather than in developing their own software and other products. I think they could expand into different industries that have growing demand for implementation of complex IT systems. They seem to have had a lot of success in the automotive, manufacturing and healthcare sectors. Perhaps they could expand to other industries such as education.

* I believe that helping industies adopt AI technology and improving their data handling capabilities can provide them the insights needed to increase profitability and ensure success. NTT Data is one company that can help with these efforts.

* I think that the partnerships with Google and IBM in AI will undoubtably change the way NTT Data has operated. I believe they are rethinking and transforming many of their technologies currently. Fortunately transformation and innovation is an area where they excel.

* These new technologies are at the core of what NTT Data has always done. Being such a large company they may not always be at the cutting edge but they certainly know how to adapt quickly and utlize new and emerging technologies to provide world class IT solutions for their clients.
